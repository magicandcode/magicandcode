                        This is the first of three parts in a series on how to achieve
                        an acceptable Windows experience coming from MacOS (or Linux).

                        We'll start by fixing the appearance. It may be superficial but I can't bear the default look of Windows 10. Especially not after being used to work with a MacBook Pro. If you are of a similar disposition, fear not, there is hope! After changing a series of default settings you too can achieve an acceptable Windows appearance.

                    <p>
                        By default, the size of apps and text is set to (<em>a lot</em>) more than 100%, which doesn’t leave much room for applications, especially not vertically. Programmers are generally more concerned with screen <strong>height</strong> than <strong>width</strong>, since we want to see as many lines of code as possible. The overly large default settings in combination with the fact that most PC:s have a 16:9 display ratio (meaning they are more fitted to show HD video than code) is simply unworkable for a programmer. Especially if you’re used to the wonderful MacBook 16:10 Retina display. While we won’t achieve Retina status, we can change the default size.

The setting is called <span class="path">Make everything bigger</span> but we want to do the opposite and decrease the default percentage. The default value will depend on your device and the display size but generally you’ll always want to decrease from the default. Note that 100% may be too tiny depending on your display. I find 125% to be proficient and it makes a world of difference to my 14” device’s default of 150%.

                    <p>
                        Now that we hopefully can see better what we're doing it's time to fix the Desktop. You wouldn't think so going by my former MacBook desktop (...) but I dislike desktop icons. On Windows even more so.<br>
                        But before we get into icons, you’ll want to change the typical default background image if you haven’t already.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The image varies depending on your PC’s manufacturer and if you like what you’ve got, by all means keep it. I've however gone all in for a background that does <em>not</em> remind me of Windows. The best strategy for this I find is to simply use the <strong>default</strong> background for <em>another</em> <abbr title="Operative System">OS</abbr>.<br>
                        Currently, my personal go-to background is the <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2016/09/ubuntu-16-10-default-wallpaper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubuntu 16.10 default background</a>. It’s a perfect blend of subtlety and colour, and more importantly, it's decidedly <em>not</em> Windows-esque. I like this background so much that I also use with Ubuntu 18.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once you've got a nice shiny background you don't want to clutter it with ugly icons, right? While one can get a custom icons theme, I find it's sufficient to just get rid of all of them. But unless you know how, it can be a very frustrating experience.<br>
                        Personally I've tried to bin the Recycle Bin icon more times than I'm willing to admit. Someone I know resigned and dragged it to a remote corner of the screen.<br>
                        However the good news is that you <em>can</em> get rid of it for good; Bin the Bin once and for all.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While in <span class="path">Settings</span> go to <span class="path">Personalisation > Themes</span>. Scrolling down there should be a header <span class="path">Related settings</span> and a link to <span class="path">Desktop icons settings</span>. This opens a new dialog where you're presented with available icons to display on the Desktop. Each icon has a checkbox and by unchecking all you'll finally have that clutter free Desktop I've always dreamed of.<br>
                        This is also where you cange icon images if you're so inclined. Make sure that <span class="path">Allow themes to change desktop icons</span> is selected. Then you can change the icons by selecting a new theme. I've never used a theme (other than the custom theme implicitly created by making changes) so I won't discuss it further. But it's an area to explore if the resulting appearance after going through all the steps isn't satisfactory.

                        If you, like me, miss the sleek black mouse pointer in MacOS I have good news. Go to <span class="path">Settings > Ease of Access > Mouse Pointer</span> (or <span class="path">Settings > Personalisation > Themes > Mouse Cursor</span>) and change the pointer colour. Sure, you won’t get the colourful beachball of dread, just a slightly more sophisticated black hourglass, but it’s miles better than the Windows default.<br>
                        If you wish to be even more colourful you can choose a custom pointer colour. I was tempted, but ended up with black all the same. It works well and feels like home.<br>
                        For some reason I thought one could never have a black pointer on Windows. The slight change makes a huge difference and I was thoroughly elated when I discovered that one can indeed.

                    <p>
                        One of the things that make Windows look an awful lot like Windows, is its default light and frankly uninspiring colour scheme.<br>
                        By selecting dark mode for <em>everything</em> (and keeping transparency <strong>ON</strong>) you remove the bland native office-look and transition into something more Ubuntu-esque. Which in my opinion is a considerable improvement. You can set a custom mode, using different themes for <strong>apps</strong> and <strong>system</strong> but I don't recommend it. Sticking to one colour for both makes for a more consistent look.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Next, change the accent colour. The default colour is called <em>Default Blue</em>, not the way to go if you want to leave the Windows feel behind.<br>
                        I use purple in MacOS wherefore <em>Orchid</em> is a solid choice. You can also choose a custom colour to get the colour just right but I'm happy with good enough in this case.

                        Windows may undoubtedly look better in black, but there are situations that require a light theme. Many laptops have mediocre and dim screens. A light theme when going outside is pretty much a must for practicality. But I'll use dark mode as long as I can get away with it.<br>
                        Going outside is something I do a lot when the weather permits. That requires a change of not only the system mode but also the themes of the applications I use. To simplify the switch I've written <a href="https://github.com/magicandcode/theme-toggler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a script to toggle between dark and light mode for multiple applications</a>. It's a work in progress but feel free to check it out and let me know if you have any issues.

                        This is the screen that displays when you’re logged out from your account. By default it’s very busy looking with a random (granted, beautiful) background image. This didn’t work for me and I made changes to just stick with the basics.<br>
                        There are quite a few settings to change here, starting with the background. I’m no fan of animations and things that move in UI:s so I prefer just a static background image. I use the desktop background image, no need to change a winning concept.
